\textcolor{orange}{How have histories of segregation and isolation informed education, health, and political outcomes?}

- Racial segregation

- Economic segregation

- Dynamic features of isolation

# A History of Dividing Walls

There are dynamic and complex historical structures that have segregated individuals based on a host of factors.

- Legacies of Jim Crow (e.g., highways)

- Redlining

- Gerrymandering

- Gentrification

# Considering Multiple Dimensions

How might we analyze the \textcolor{orange}{multidimensional patchwork of a city's fabric} while retaining critical insights from theorists that challenge monolithic narratives of any single group?

---

# Theoretical framework: A Patchwork Nation

| "*If you pay attention to the complexity of the USA, its diversity and differences you soon realize that the ways we try to understand it – red and blue, Northeast and Midwest – are too simplistic. They are inadequate and misleading*." -Patchwork Nation Project

![[Community types in the Patchwork Nation](https://jeffersoninst.org/projects/patchwork-nation){target="_blank"}](img/patchwork-profiles.jpg){width="55%" fig-align="center"}

---

### Details of community types (national-level)

- **Boom Towns**: Rapidly "expanding" communities

- **Campus and Careers**: Areas with a significant presence of higher education institutions

- **Immigration Nation**: Areas with high concentrations of immigrant populations

- **Industrial Metropolis**: Large urban areas with a strong industrial base

- **Emptying Nests**: Communities with an aging population

- **Minority Central**: Areas with large minority populations

- **Monied Burbs**: Affluent suburban areas

---

# Analytic Framework: Theory of Dividing Walls (city-level)

Consider a neighborhood as an "island" containing towns — the green tribe in two of the towns and the blue tribe in the other two.

## Analytic framework

Using topology (mathematics) and topography (geology), we can formalize our analysis by attaching a few requirements:

- The wall must be continuous, it must not intersect itself, it must not split, it must not pass through a town, and each end of the wall must be at the coast. 

- Let us call such a wall a dividing wall.

## Dividing Walls Theorem

![](img/Picture2.png){width="25%" fig-align="center"}

::::{.theorem}

**Theorem 1**. Given any configuration of blue and green towns, there is a dividing wall that separates blue towns from green towns.

## Measurement Model: Dissimilarity Index

$$
D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Big| \dfrac{b_i}{B} - \dfrac{w_i}{W} \Big|
$$
Where:

  - $b_i$ = Black population in tract $i$

  - $B$ = Total Black population in city

  - $w_i$ = non-Black population in tract $i$

  - $W$ = non-Black population in city

This census data model, however, only provides a single dimension of a neighborhood.

---

## Community Resilience Estimates

- The CRE are a [measure of the capacity of individuals and households within a community]{style="color:blue;"} to absorb, endure, and recover from external stresses. 

- The CRE data combine American Community Survey (ACS) and the Population Estimates Program (PEP) data to [identify social and economic vulnerabilities by geography]{style="color:blue;"}.

- There is a nice [CRE Interactive Tool](https://mtgis-portal.geo.census.gov/arcgis/apps/experiencebuilder/experience/?id=54292fa3918e425a8717259f930274fb){target="_blank"} that allows for a quick overview of local contexts.

## Spatial Model

-- Base spatial model formulation: $$ \mathbf{y} = \boldsymbol{X}\beta + \tau + \epsilon $$

- $\boldsymbol{y}$ is a $n$ x $1$ response vector

- $\boldsymbol{X}$ is a design matrix that contains explanatory variables

- $\beta$ represents fixed effects coefficients

- $\tau$ denotes spatially dependent random errors

- $\epsilon$ represents independent random errors

---

## Dimensionality in Spatial Models

Response vector structure ($\mathbf{y}$): 

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \mathbf{y} &= \begin{bmatrix}
    y_1 \\ 
    y_2 \\ 
    \vdots \\ 
    y_n
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Each element, $y_i$, represents the observed response at a neighborhood's location $i$

- These are ordered by adjacency relationships to preserve the geographical context

- Review of distributions, spatial autocorrelation (i.e., $Cov(y_i, y_j)$), and decomposition

---

## Dimensionality in Spatial Models

Design matrix of explanatory variables structure ($\boldsymbol{X}$):

$$
\boldsymbol{X} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_{1, 1} & \ldots & x_{1, p} \\
1 & x_{2, 1} & \ldots & x_{2, p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_{n, 1} & \ldots & x_{n, p} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- First column is the intercept term

- Subsequent columns represent $p$ explanatory variables

- Each row corresponds to a specific neighborhood's covariates

---

## Dimensionality in Spatial Models

### [Sample design matrix of explanatory variables]{style="color:blue;"}

$$
\boldsymbol{X} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 65,000 & 0.62 & 3,200 \\
1 & 28,000 & 0.32 & 5,100 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
1 & 127,000 & 0.75 & 6,840 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- Column 1 is the $E(\mathbf{y})$ when all other predictors are zero

- Variable 1 (col 2) as median income

- Variable 2 (col 3) as proportion of residents with HS diploma

- Variable 3 (col 4) as population density (residents/sq. mi)

---

## Next steps: Information and spatial segregation

There are multiple models for consideration:

- Spatial regression using intersectional interactions

- Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with CRE components

- Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Analysis (MAIHDA)

  - Evans et al. (2024). A Tutorial for Conducting MAIHDA. *Population Health*, Vol. 26, 101664

  - Combines intersectional stratification with neighborhood-level clustering

  - Models individuals nested within: Intersectional strata (e.g., low-income Black men), community typologies from framework (e.g., Patchwork Nation) classifications
